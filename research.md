Although my background is in economics, my research interests are broad and interdisciplinary. 
I'm interested in digital infrastructures as well as urban ones, and am especially curious about the nexus of the two ("smart cities").

  A paper I wrote for Prof. David Wachsmuth's URBP 553 Urban Governance course. In the course, we read feminist critiques of urban planning; specifically, the spatial and gendered division of suburban and urban realms of life. I used street network connectivity data and census data in Canada to evaluate the claim that disconnected cities disadvantage women economically.


* [A survey of the policy landscape on street connectivity](/assets/academic/ihsp-final-urbanpolicy.pdf) (Fall 2019)

  The final report I produced under Prof. Chris Barrington-Leigh's supervision for the IHSP research internship. In this paper, I explore how Canada, the United Kingdom, Ghana, South Africa and the Philippines have made plans for urban development. In particular, the spatial policies (in the form of plans and guidelines) that address street network connectivity are of interest to this survey.


### Public engagement:
* [sprawlmap.org/places](https://sprawlmap.org/places/)

  I built summary pages on street-network sprawl trends and data for the world's cities, regions, and countries. Some of these pages were featured by my PI in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/connected-city-streets-mean-healthier-residents-and-communities-140521)!
