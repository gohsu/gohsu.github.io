## Coursework I'm proud of:

* [The regressivity of carbon prices](/assets/academic/406-policybrief-carbon.pdf) (Winter 2019)

  A policy brief summarizing the findings of Grainger and Kolstad's “Who Pays a Price on Carbon”. Written for ECON 406 Topics in Economic Policy, which was the course that opened my eyes to what econ could be used for and made me fall in love.

* [Trade-offs in Cash Transfer Programs: Lessons from Malawi](/assets/academic/406-policybrief-cct.pdf) (Winter 2019)

  A policy brief summarizing the findings of Baird, McIntosh and Özler's “Cash or Condition? Evidence from a Cash Transfer Experiment”. Also written for ECON 406.
 
* [The Conception of Man: Understanding William Blake and Jan Van Rymsdyk’s Art Through Their Approach to Science](/assets/academic/arth-man.pdf) (Winter 2018)

  I ventured a little ways out of my comfort zone to take an art history elective (ARTH 226 Intro to 18th Century Art) and loved it!

## Writing

I don't get the opportunity to write a lot in my program, but I've found other avenues to explore interesting issues. These are my favorite (best?) pieces as a writer for The Grassroots Journal:

* [Transgender athletes: a league of their own?](https://www.thegrassrootsjournal.org/post/2019/03/22/transgender-athletes-a-league-of-their-own) (2019)
* [Technology and representation](https://www.thegrassrootsjournal.org/post/2018/01/22/technology-and-representation) (2018)
* [Sand: coarse, rough, and running out](https://www.thegrassrootsjournal.org/post/2017/12/16/sand-coarse-rough-and-running-out) (2017)
